Code in Place Final Project - Sleep Tracker

The sleep tracker will calculate how many hours you slept per night across one week (Monday to Sunday) and print out a summary of your sleep duration for that week.
You can use this to track your sleep across a single week.
To mitigate any errors happening, please ensure you input the date and time according to the format provided in the prompt.
